## What is Empty Set Dollar?

Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is an algorithmic stablecoin built to be the reserve currency of Decentralized Finance. The protocol is centred around an [ERC-20](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) token: [ESD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/empty-set-dollar). This token acts both as the stabilized dollar and as the governance token for the protocol. 

In order to self-stabilize, the protocol uses voluntary supply expansions and contractions around a Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle from the incentivized trading pool on Uniswap.

## Features

ESD has composed a number of different mechanics from various projects into a single protocol. This combination gives it unique features.

- **Decentralised** - Only upgradable via on-chain token governance 
- **Self-Stabilising** - Uses an on-chain price oracle
- **Composable** - The token is a plain ERC-20 token which acts as a stablecoin & a governance token
- **Opt-in Supply Adjustments** - All supply expansions & contractions are incentivised & voluntary
