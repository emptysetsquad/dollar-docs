# Protocol Overview

The second iteration of the Empty Set protocol was designed to provide a stable, governable, & decentralized stablecoin. These elements are key to the ethos of DeFi and are a must for any protocol that will become a key piece of DeFi infrastructure.

In contrast to the first version of the protocol, v2 of Empty Set launches with no algorithmic or under-collateralised elements. The use of a 100% reserve ratio will ensure a smooth launch and any stability mechanisms can be introduced further down the line with the active involvement of the community.

## Aims

#### Stable

Ensuring the **DSU** stablecoin is able to maintain a tight price range is paramount to the success of the protocol. This is key to providing confidence to protocols integrating Empty Set as a base unit.

#### Decentralized

Unlike centralized stablecoins that are based in specific regulatory regions that maintain blacklists Empty Set aims to have globally distributed stakeholders to ensure the decentralisation of the network.

#### Governable

The protocol is governable by the **ESS** token which has the ability to propose governance actions and vote on them.
